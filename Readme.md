# Google Cast Receiver for F1 TV

A custom Google Cast receiver to work with authenticated F1 TV streams. Supports language and closed caption tracks.

### Work in Progress
* Branding / styling needs to be done

### Known Issues
* Older F1 race streams do not Cast because of a stricter CORS policy for webpage origin. Possible workaround is proxy HLS calls using Lambda functions on Netlify.

## Contributions

This code is super quick and dirty / proof of concept level. It's ugly but gets the job done. Wanna make it better? Feel free to send in a PR!

I built this extension for fun to learn more about building Google Cast applications. That said, it did take a bit of time (and a teeny bit of money). If you found it helpful, I'd appreciate any donations! You can contribute [here](https://paypal.me/nishanth)
